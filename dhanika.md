# Dhanika: A Vibe-Coded Budget Tracker

This project, **Dhanika**, is the result of a personal experiment in "vibe coding." It started as a simple tool to solve a real-life problem of mine: to truly understand where my money was going. While spreadsheets are powerful, I wanted something more intuitive, more visual, and something that respected my privacy completely.

This is more than just a budget app; it's a testament to a development philosophy centered on intuition, user experience, and solving tangible problems with the tools at hand.

## Core Philosophy & Vibe

-   **Privacy by Design**: In a world of data harvesting, Dhanika takes a firm stance. All your financial data lives and dies in your browser's local storage. There is no server, no database, no tracking. It's your data, period.
-   **Vibe-Driven Development**: This wasn't a project built on rigid sprints and a huge backlog. It was "vibe coded"â€”organically grown feature by feature, based on what felt right and what was needed next. The goal was to create something that felt good to use.
-   **Solving My Own Problem**: The best projects often come from a personal need. I was the first user, and this tool was built to satisfy my own requirements for a simple, beautiful, and effective budget tracker.

## The Tech Stack: Keepin' it Vanilla

The beauty of this project lies in its simplicity and power, achieved without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: The entire application logic is built with modern, clean JavaScript. No React, no Vue, no Angular. This keeps it lightweight and fast.
-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structured with semantic HTML and styled with modern CSS, including Flexbox and Grid.
-   **Bootstrap 5**: Used for the responsive grid system and core components, providing a solid foundation.
-   **Chart.js**: For beautiful, responsive, and interactive data visualizations.
-   **Web APIs**: Leverages the power of the browser with the **LocalStorage API** for data persistence and the **Web Crypto API** for secure, client-side encryption.

## Recent Evolution & Improvements

### **Enhanced Transaction Management (Latest Update)**
The recent development cycle focused on creating a truly seamless transaction management experience:

-   **Unified Edit Experience**: Developed a modal-based transaction editor that maintains the exact same UI patterns as the home screen, ensuring users never feel lost or confused when editing data
-   **Smart Data Loading**: Implemented intelligent category and tag population that works consistently across both home and transactions pages, solving complex path resolution challenges
-   **Mobile UX Refinements**: Completely redesigned the mobile transaction list with proper responsive grid layouts, touch-friendly controls, and optimized typography scaling

### **Technical Achievements**
-   **Zero-Framework Architecture**: Proved that modern, complex UIs can be built entirely with vanilla JavaScript while maintaining excellent performance and user experience
-   **Client-Side Security**: Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption entirely in the browser using Web Crypto APIs, ensuring data can be safely exported without server-side dependencies
-   **Responsive Excellence**: Created adaptive layouts that seamlessly transition from mobile-first design to desktop-optimized interfaces without sacrificing functionality
-   **Data Consistency**: Built a robust client-side data architecture that maintains consistency across multiple views and interaction patterns

### **User Experience Innovation**
-   **Intuitive Flow Design**: Every user action flows naturally to the next, from adding transactions to viewing insights to managing data
-   **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features are revealed progressively, keeping the interface clean while providing power users with advanced capabilities
-   **Accessibility-First**: Built with semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation support from the ground up

## The Philosophy Realized

This project is an ongoing experiment in creating useful, beautiful, and private software. It's a demonstration of how far you can go with just the core technologies of the web, a clear vision, and a bit of vibe.

The latest improvements showcase how thoughtful iteration, user-focused development, and attention to detail can create experiences that rival or exceed those built with heavy frameworks - all while respecting user privacy and maintaining lightning-fast performance.
